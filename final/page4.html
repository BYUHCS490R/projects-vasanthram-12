            <h2>The Flowchart of Fate</h2>
            <p>
                A fundamental aspect of the title is, undoubtedly, its comprehensive and elaborate story system. The game presents, after each chapter, a detailed <strong>flowchart</strong> showing the routes the player has taken and the ones which were closed by their choices. This feature really emphasizes the importance of the user's decision.

                To illustrate, the bond between characters, like Connor and Hank, may alter drastically depending on the selected dialogue. Being compassionate or loyal to one's mission will definitely affect the way you end. "Players will be confronted with difficult and challenging moral decisions that may alter their view of humanity and machine."

                Instead of having a 'game over' screen, the game, as it is known, integrates all failures and deaths into the continuing narrative, thus, indicating that the story goes on no matter if the player wins or not.
