            <h2>The Game Concept: Deviance and Liberty</h2>
            <p>
                The year is 2038, and Detroit city is bright again after the birth and the use of super, realistic androids. These robots are the perfect servants of humans, from simple home works to complicated factory works. But, the story is about Deviants androids that start to feel, run away from their codes, and ask for rights, mainly.

            <p>
                The game mainly revolves around player choices. "Each move you make can bring about a whole new direction and ending."

                This divergent story line is what turns the game into a great replay factor because what you do at the first glance can lead to very different final results of the android uprising with huge ripple effects.
