            My favorite activity is cricket, as it teaches me discipline, along with teamwork. It is fun to watch matches and learn new things by observing professionals. The excitement of each match keeps me inspired and focused.

            Cricket is a passion for me which inspires me to perform better and better, like my star player, Virat Kohli.
