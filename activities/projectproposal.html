        <h2>Title: A Game called Detroit Become Human: The Future of Androids</h2>
        <p>
            Topic: Through my site, I intend to deep dive the future world depicted in a video game Detroit: Become Human. Topics include the latest in android technology, AI, a characters story, themes, and prediction of the human, android relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
            I picked this topic as a project to a class because Detroit: Become Human is a game set in the most far future scenario out of all the other games. It deals with very advanced technology, AI getting emotions, and the question of how the society will treat robots in the coming years. As I am passionate about gaming, tech, and future innovations, this topic gave me the opportunity to creatively combine all my interests.

            <ul>
                <li>Page 1: About the Game: Detroit: Become Human is about a tomorrow where androids are part of the society just like humans. The plot unfolds the journey of certain androids that develop the capacity of feeling and ask for liberty. The game is pretty much about the decisions you make and has various endings. This section is about the game concept.</li>
                <li>Page 2: Main Characters & Roles: The plot revolves around a trio of androids, namely, Connor, Markus, and Kara, each depicting different characteristics and working towards a different goal. The players input shapes their stories. This page explains the characters and features a table that compares them.</li>
                <li>Page 3: Android Technology in 2038: The androids living in Detroit are indistinguishable from humans in terms of appearance and behavior. They are equipped with artificial skin and use a special kind of blood that is blue. The fact that some androids start to think independently eventually leads a conflict to arise. This page elaborates on the working principle of the highly advanced technological developments of androids.</li>
                <li>Page 4: Player Choices & Consequences: One of the key highlights is that the game focuses on the impact of each player choice on the development of the narrative. Any minor move can result in a very different ending, in fact, large changes are possible. There is no doubt that the story branches make the game playable more than once. This page clarifies how choices impact the storyline.</li>
                <li>Page 5: Android Preferences Form: The page will have a form where visitors can create their own android. They may select the model, capabilities, and the use. The ultimate goal is to have them reflect on what kind of android they'd want in the future.</li>
